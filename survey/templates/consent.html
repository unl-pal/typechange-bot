        <p>You have contributed to a project that is participating in a
            research study (“Understanding Developers’ Addition and Removal of Type
            Annotations”, IRB# 23988, Approval 20241023988EX) conducted by Dr. Robert Dyer (<a
                                                                                               href="https://github.com/psybers">https://github.com/psybers</a>) and
            Mr. Samuel W. Flint (<a
                                     href="https://github.com/swflint">https://github.com/swflint</a>) at the
            <a href="https://unl.edu">University of Nebraska-Lincoln</a>.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this research is to understand the reasons why
            developers add and remove type annotations in languages where type
            annotations are optional. If you are at least 19 years of age, and a
            contributor to this project, you may participate in this research.</p>
        <p>Reasonable steps will be taken to protect the privacy and
            confidentiality of your study data; however, in some circumstances, we
            cannot guarantee absolute privacy and/or confidentiality. Research
            records will be stored electronically through university-approved
            methods and where they originate on GitHub. Records will only be seen by
            the research team and/or those authorized to view, access, or use the
            records during and after the study is complete. Your GitHub username
            will be included with the data and published in the results.</p>
        <p>Participation in this study will require approximately two minutes
            each time you choose to participate. You will be asked to respond in public  to a
            brief question about a commit you recently made. Participation
            will take place through GitHub commit comments.  If you contribute to multiple monitored
            projects, we will not request your consent again but may contact you
            for each project.</p>
        <p>Society may benefit from this research by having increased
            information and understanding of developer behavior, which may lead to
            better developer tooling, increased productivity, and better education
            of future software developers.</p>
        <p>If you are interested in participating, please reply to the comment
            which sent you here with <code>@typechangebot[bot] CONSENT</code>. By
            doing so, you acknowledge that you are at least 19 years of age.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions about this study, you may contact either of
            the researchers, whose contact information is listed below.</p>
        <p>You can decide not to be in this research study, or you can withdraw
            at any time before, during, or after the research begins for any reason.
            Deciding not to be in this research study or deciding to withdraw will
            not affect your relationship with the investigators or the University of
            Nebraska-Lincoln. You will not lose any benefits to which you are
            entitled. You are voluntarily deciding whether to
            participate in this research study. By entering the command as directed,
            your consent to participate is implied. You should print or save a copy
            of this page for your records.</p>
        <p>If you have questions about your rights or complaints about the
            research, you may contact the UNL Institutional Review Board (contact
            information listed below).</p>
        <h3 id="opt-out-revocation-of-consent-and-study-data-removal">Opt-Out,
            Revocation of Consent, and Study Data Removal</h3>
        <p>You may opt out of this study at any time, using the command
            <code>@typechangebot[bot] OPTOUT</code>. This will opt you out of future
            requests across any of our monitored projects. If you would like to
            opt in again, you may use the command
            <code>@typechangebot[bot] CONSENT</code> on any monitored project
            commit.</p>
        <p>You may request that your data be removed from the study at any time
            before data collection is completed by using the command
            <code>@typechangebot[bot] REMOVE</code>. This will also have the effect
            of opting you out of the study. Upon receiving this command, we will
            remove from our server all study-related data to which you are directly connected, except for that necessary for us to maintain the
            opt-out list. We will retain only the record of your initial consent and
            your request for data removal.</p>
