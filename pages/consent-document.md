## Informed Consent

You have contributed to a project which is participating in a research study ("Understanding Developers' Addition and Removal of Type Annotations", IRB# 23988) operated by Dr. Robert Dyer ([https://github.com/psybers](https://github.com/psybers)) and Mr. Samuel W. Flint ([https://github.com/swflint](https://github.com/swflint)) at the [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://unl.edu).

The purpose of this research is to understand the reasons why developers add and remove type annotations in languages where type annotations are optional.  If you are at least 19 years of age, and a contributor to this project, you may participate in this research.

Participation in this study will require approximately five minutes each time you choose to participate.  You will be asked to respond to a brief question about a commit you have made in public.  Participation will take place through GitHub commit comments.

Society may benefit from this research by having increased information and understanding of developer behavior, which may lead to better developer tooling, increased productivity, and better education of future software developers.

If you are interested in participating, please reply to the comment which sent you here with `@UNLPALBOTUSERACCT CONSENT`. By doing so, you acknowledge that you are at least 19 years of age.

During the course of data collection, you may request that your study data is removed.
