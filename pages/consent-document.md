## Informed Consent

You have contributed to a project which is participating in a research study ("Understanding Developers' Addition and Removal of Type Annotations", IRB# 23988) operated by Dr. Robert Dyer ([https://github.com/psybers](https://github.com/psybers)) and Mr. Samuel W. Flint ([https://github.com/swflint](https://github.com/swflint)) at the [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://unl.edu).

The purpose of this research is to understand the reasons why developers add and remove type annotations in languages where type annotations are optional.  If you are at least 19 years of age, and a contributor to this project, you may participate in this research.

Participation in this study will require approximately five minutes each time you choose to participate.  You will be asked to respond to a brief question about a commit you have made in public.  Participation will take place through GitHub commit comments.

Society may benefit from this research by having increased information and understanding of developer behavior, which may lead to better developer tooling, increased productivity, and better education of future software developers.

If you are interested in participating, please reply to the comment which sent you here with `@UNLPALBOTUSERACCT CONSENT`. By doing so, you acknowledge that you are at least 19 years of age.

If you have any questions about this study, you may contact either of the researchers, whose contact information is listed below.

### Opt-Out, Revocation of Consent, and Study Data Removal

You may opt-out of this study at any time, using the command `@UNLPALBOTUSERACCT OPTOUT`.  This will opt you out of future requests across any of our monitored projects.  If you would like to opt-in again, you may use the command `@UNLPALBOTUSERACCT CONSENT` on any monitored project commit.

You may request that your data is removed from the study at any time before data collection is completed by using the command `@UNLPALBOTUSERACCT REMOVE`.  This will also have the effect of opting you out of the study.  Upon receiving this command, we will remove all study-related data to which you are directly connected from our server, except for that which is necessary for us to maintain the opt-out list.  We will retain only the record of your initial consent and your request for data removal.
